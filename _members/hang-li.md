Hang Li is currently a PhD candidate at IELab in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland, Australia, where he works closely with A/Prof. Guido Zuccon, Dr. Bevan Koopman, and Dr. Ahmed Mourad. Prior to Ph.D, Hang received his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities in United States in 2016.

Hang works at the intersection of Conversational Search, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML) applications, where he utilises different relevance feedbacks to empower the conversational search system. His recent work seeks to address the gap between relevance feedback, deep language models, and conversational search through different approaches that helps to improve the conversational system effectiveness with minimal efficiency cost.

Hang publishes at premier academic venues in IR (e.g. SIGIR, ECIR). His work is supported by Grains Research and Development Corporation, through the AgAsk project.
