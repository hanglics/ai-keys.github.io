I am a Professor at the University of Queenslandâ€™s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science School, and the Director of Artificial Intelligence for the Queensland Digital Health Center (QDHeC). I am the research leader of the ielab. I had been an ARC DECRA Fellow (2018-2020). My research interests span a number of topics:

- Formal models of Information Retrieval; 

- Medical/Health Information Retrieval and Data Science;

- Health Search Evaluation;

If you are a UQ student, or a prospective one, and you are interested to work with me as part of your studies, you can find ideas for research projects for PhD and other research degrees here. I also welcome international higher education students wanting to do a research visit and collaborating on ideas within my research interests.

See my publications below for more information, and my Google Scholar profile for an up to date list of publications including citation metrics.
